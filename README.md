UCETD LaTeX Class & Template
============================

This repository includes a soon-to-be-official LaTeX class and template for
correctly formatted electronic Ph.D. dissertations.

The [official format specification][spec] can be tough to meet from scratch.
That's why we are providing this class and template. The class, when properly
used as in the template, will make sure your dissertation meets the spec.

Plus, if you need any help with LaTeX and its quirks, or have problems with the
LaTeX class, you can ask the current maintainer of this package (currently
[Michael Victor Zink](mailto:mvzink@uchicago.edu)) to help you out.
